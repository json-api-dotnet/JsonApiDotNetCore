# Intro
Documentation for JsonApiDotNetCore is produced using [docfx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) from several files in this directory.
In addition, the example request/response pairs are generated by executing `curl` commands against the GettingStarted project.

# Installation
You need to have 'npm' installed. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/.

# Running
The next command regenerates the documentation website and opens it in your default browser:

```
pwsh ./build-dev.ps1
```
