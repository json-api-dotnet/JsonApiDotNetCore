The ultimate goal of this library is to eliminate as much boilerplate as possible by offering out-of-the-box features such as sorting, filtering and pagination. You just need to focus on defining the resources and implementing your custom business logic. This library has been designed around dependency injection, making extensibility incredibly easy.

## Installation and Usage

See [our documentation](https://www.jsonapi.net/) for detailed usage.

### Models

```c#
#nullable enable

[Resource]
public class Article : Identifiable<int>
{
    [Attr]
    public string Name { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

### Middleware

// Program.cs

builder.Services.AddJsonApi<AppDbContext>();

// ...

app.UseRouting();
app.UseJsonApi();
app.MapControllers();
```

## Trying out the latest build

After each commit to the master branch, a new pre-release NuGet package is automatically published to [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-nuget-registry).
To try it out, follow the steps below:

1. [Create a Personal Access Token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with at least `read:packages` scope.
1. Add our package source to your local user-specific `nuget.config` file by running:
   ```bash
   dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/json-api-dotnet/index.json --name github-json-api --username YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME --password YOUR-PAT-CLASSIC
   ```
   In the command above:
   - Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME with the username you use to login your GitHub account.
   - Replace YOUR-PAT-CLASSIC with the token your created above.
   
   :warning: If the above command doesn't give you access in the next step, remove the package source by running:
   ```bash
   dotnet nuget remove source github-json-api
   ```
   and retry with the `--store-password-in-clear-text` switch added.
1. Restart your IDE, open your project, and browse the list of packages from the github-json-api feed (make sure pre-release packages are included).

## Development

To build the code from this repository locally, run:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Running tests locally requires access to a PostgreSQL database. If you have docker installed, this can be propped up via:

```bash
pwsh run-docker-postgres.ps1
```

And then to run the tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Alternatively, to build, run all tests, generate code coverage and NuGet packages:

```bash
pwsh Build.ps1
```
