# JsonApiDotNetCore roadmap

This document provides an overview of the direction this project is heading and lists what we intend to work on in the near future.

> Disclaimer: This is an open source project. The available time of our contributors varies and therefore we do not plan release dates. This document expresses our current intent, which may change over time.

## v4.x

We've completed active development on v4.x, but we'll still fix important bugs or add small enhancements on request that don't require breaking changes nor lots of testing.

## v5.x

The need for breaking changes has blocked several efforts in the v4.x release, so now that we're starting work on v5, we're going to catch up.
