A framework for building [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) compliant REST APIs using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. Includes support for the [Atomic Operations](https://jsonapi.org/ext/atomic/) extension.

The ultimate goal of this library is to eliminate as much boilerplate as possible by offering out-of-the-box features, such as sorting, filtering, pagination, sparse fieldset selection, and side-loading related resources. You just need to focus on defining the resources and implementing your custom business logic. This library has been designed around dependency injection, making extensibility incredibly easy.
